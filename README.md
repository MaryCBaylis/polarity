# Polarity

## A stab at making a Javascript game with a prebuilt library.

## Premise

A player tries to navigate stages.  Typical platformer stuff, running and jumping and all.  Except the player is a magnet that can choose to turn on her positive or negative charge.  Naturally, there will be elements in the stage that she can use to move herself around the stage using her magnetic charge.  Hopefully physics will be fun.

## Starting point

1. Let's get the player on the screen and moving.
2. Look at her go!  I grabbed a free spritesheet from opengamea.art.org.  It looks like I'm missing a jump left frame.  Argh.  I like the sprite, too.  Oh well, you get what you pay for.
3. Magnet nodes have made an appearance!  Now let's give Po (our heroine) some magnetic powers.
4. Freaking Magneto!  Or... Magneta?  Whatevs.  She's got a "circle of influence" now, or "coi" for short.  Let's make it work!
5. Yeehaw!  She sure can fling herself!  That's kind of the point.  I had a lot of fun figuring out the physics of this one.  But I think gravity is messing up her upwards charges.  Let's fix it!
6. Time to move onto to making a stage.
