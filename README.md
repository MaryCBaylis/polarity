# Polarity

## A stab at making a Javascript game with a prebuilt library.

## Premise

A player tries to navigate stages.  Typical platformer stuff, running and jumping and all.  Except the player is a magnet that can choose to turn on her positive or negative charge.  Naturally, there will be elements in the stage that she can use to move herself around the stage using her magnetic charge.  Hopefully physics will be fun.

## Starting point

Let's get the player on the screen and moving.
